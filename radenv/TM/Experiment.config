# Run script selection:
#  flight.sh looks in the following locations:
#
# SCRIPT_OVERRIDE is the location of a file containing
# the name of a script. The file will be deleted after
# the contents are read. This gives the invoking procedure
# first choice of startup script. If SCRIPT_OVERRIDE is
# not defined or the file does not exist:
#
# PICKFILE is an action that is executed in the TMBINDIR
# that outputs the name of a script file. If PICKFILE
# is not defined:
#
# RUNFILE is the name of a script. If RUNFILE is not defined:
#
# The script name is "runfile.dflt"

# We only want to run interactively
SCRIPT_OVERRIDE=script
# RUNFILE=interact

# In order for a doit script to override the startup script,
# you need to specify the batchfile parameter in the doit
# and the SCRIPT_OVERRIDE location in Experiment.config
